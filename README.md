# Machine-Learning

This is a repository for projects related to machine learning. There is currently one project, coded in Python, within this repository. This project was developed by my group to develop multiple machine learning models to predict the price of a home given a set of information about that home. All files within the Random Forest folder of this project are implemented by me.
